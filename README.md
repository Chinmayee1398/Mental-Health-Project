# Welcome to HappyFox 🦊 - A Modern Mental Health Application Project

HappyFox is a user-friendly mental health app developed as a project for the Master Course Fundamentals of UI&UX in SRH University Heidelberg.
Our aim was to create an app that not only promotes emotional well-being and mental balance but also incorporates key principles of UI and UX design.

## Software & Technologies Used
  The Happy Fox mental health app was developed using the following technologies and software:

- **Figma**: Used for designing wireframes, prototypes, user flows, and components of the app.

- **VSCode** for HTML and CSS: Utilized for frontend development, providing structure and styling to the app's user interface. VSCode extensions were used to enhance the development experience, including
  - Live Server: Facilitated local development by allowing quick viewing and testing of the app in a web browser.
  - Prettier Extension: Ensured consistent code formatting and enhanced code readability.
    
- **Adobe Photoshop 2023**: Employed for image editing, small visual fixes, and creating high-quality mockups.
